### Description of how each user testing was conducted 

#### Student 1 - 4

We met all our test subjects in Sólin in Reykjavík University, and there we followed our RAMES framework to conduct the user testing. 
Kevin was the interviewer and Randver was the observer. 

### Description the results of each user test. 

#### Student 1 
Had a hard time with task 1: Change the font to another font. The student misunderstood the interface twice
when task 1 was in process. Otherwise everything else was really straightforward and smooth. Had no problems with
the other tasks.
The student was satisfied with our software and would recommend it to others, however would like us to display the settings in a 
more prominent place.

#### Student 2

Had less issues with task 1, maybe we overdid it with the explanation after the first interview. Was a pretty smooth interview and overall went smooth.
There was literally no feedback from this user.
